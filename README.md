# helloasso-discord-role

A script to help you sync an HelloAsso membership to a Discord server role.

## Requirements

- Python 3, tested against 3.9 and + only
- A Discord server
- A bot on that server, with permissions to add and remove roles to members
- An HelloAsso page
- A membership form on HelloAsso, with a custom field for a Discord username
- A persistent storage for the save file generated by the script

## Running

In a Python environment with the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`, and
configuration in a `config.yml` file in the working directory, run `python
main.py` regularly.

Example:

```bash
python -m venv
.venv\bin\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

The following procedure can be orchestrated to run regularly, using something
such as systemd Timers, a cron job, a CI pipeline, or the likes.

When you run the script, a `save.json` file will be generated or updated. This
file most importantly tracks Discord IDs, so if a member change their Discord
username, it will still be properly tracked by the script. Aside from that, the
script *should* work fine without the ability to save, but it is not the
scenario it was designed for.
